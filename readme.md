# CrossFormer-Keras

## Introduction

Welcome, brave souls, to the humble abode of CrossFormer-Keras, where PyTorch tensors turn into Keras tensors as if by magic (but actually through a lot of blood, sweat, and desperate debugging sessions). This repository is my journey of rewriting the CrossFormer, a state-of-the-art transformer model that excels in handling long-range dependencies, from PyTorch to Keras. Why, you ask? Because sometimes in life, we just want to watch the world burn. Or maybe because I enjoy pain. Either way, here we are.

## Why Keras?
You might wonder, "Why Keras?" Well, every once in a while, a person decides to climb Everest because it's there. Rewriting this in Keras seemed equally challenging and unreasonable, so it had to be done. Plus, TensorFlow said I couldn't, and I'm nothing if not petty.

## Joke aside
It was written for a project, I hope it can be helpful to someone when it will start working!
